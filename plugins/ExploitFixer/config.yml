# WARNING: Only Notifications, Connection, CustomPayload and Commands modules work on BungeeCord.
#
# This is because the other modules can't be executed on BungeeCord.
# The other modules require ExploitFixer to be installed on Spigot with HamsterAPI. (No performance impact)
#
# INSTALL THE PLUGIN ON BUNGEECORD AND ALL SPIGOT SERVERS!
#
# Most of the check use Violations (vls), this a counter to execute different
# actions on diverse levels to allow high customization of the modules.
