------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to start a Survival Server I highly recommend you to use the plugin
WorldBorder to pregenerate a World - The plugin is free but not in the setup because
it is optional and is not necessarily needed for the Setup.

I optimized Entities, Hoppers, Chunks, Spawners and much more!
If you still run into troubles with the Server dont hesitate to contact me

You can also use the plugin "Insights" to limit blocks in chunks, 
this can prevent the overuse of Redstone, Hoppers and whatever block you want.
You can also monitor lag-sources and teleport to the chunk where lag is caused.
